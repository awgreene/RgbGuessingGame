# Welcome
In this tutorial I followed the directions outlined by [Colt Steele]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/) in sections 8 through 15 of the [The Web Developer Bootcamp]( https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview ) class.

# Why I Completed the Tutorial
With a history of backend development roles, I came to realize that to become a better engineer I needed to learn more about frontend development. To most individuals, the frontend is the product, and I was always nervous about sharing examples of my work publicly because of my limited frontend development skills. After hearing about [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)'s experience, I decided that it was about time I learn more about frontend development.

# Overall Impression of this Tutorial
I found that the class covering the fundamentals of not only JavaScript but object oriented programming in general. As someone with a great deal of backend experience, many of the concepts were familiar and I found that I was more confident in these exercises than any of those in the previous lessons. Creating this game reinforced DOM manipulation principles and is my first real experience in creating an interactive website.
